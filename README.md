# RUN.game developer platform

## What's possible on RUN.game

Any genre or style of game can be made for RUN.game, as long as it's built with HTML5.

If you're new to making HTML5 games, you might be surprised by the power that modern web technology gives you. There are thousands of free, production-grade libraries out there, for just about anything you can imagine doing in 2D or 3D.

HTML5 also runs on any computer, phone, tablet, or modern gaming console, making it the best choice for sharing your games with the world. If your device has a modern web browser, it'll probably play games made with RUN.game.

We offer a [mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getreel.app) for playing your games, too! Playing in the app isn't required, but is more convenient for most players on mobile devices. The iOS app will be live soon.&#x20;
