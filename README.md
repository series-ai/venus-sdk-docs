# Venus developer platform

## What's possible on Venus

Any genre or style of game can be made for Venus, as long as it's built with HTML5.

If you're new to making HTML5 games, you might be surprised by the power that modern web technology gives you. There are thousands of free, production-grade libraries out there, for just about anything you can imagine doing in 2D or 3D.

HTML5 also runs on any computer, phone, tablet, or modern gaming console, making it the best choice for sharing your games with the world. If your device has a modern web browser, it'll probably play games made with Venus.

We offer a [mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getreel.app) for playing your games, too! Playing in the app isn't required, but is more convenient for most players on mobile devices. The iOS app will be live soon.&#x20;

## Use any IDE you like

You can use any tools you prefer to write code and create assets for games on Venus, as long as it compiles into an HTML5 web app.

Our preference is to use [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), leveraging AI to accelerate the speed of development. We provide Cursor rules that help it use our [SDK](venus-developer-platform/venus-sdk/) and features, making it much easier for you to stay focused on building great gameplay.&#x20;
