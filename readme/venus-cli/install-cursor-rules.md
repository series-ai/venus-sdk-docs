# Install Cursor rules

If you use Cursor, which we recommend, then you can give it rules that allow it to control the Venus CLI for you.&#x20;

You can say things like "deploy my game", "Share my game with my friends" or "publish my game" and it will know exactly how to use the CLI to put your game on Venus and gave you a link to share.&#x20;

In fact, all of the Venus commands should be operable with natural language once the rules are installed.

To install Cursor rules, in your Terminal, simply run:

```
cd <your project's root folder>
venus cursor init
```

Once that's done, you'll see a new `./cursor` folder in your project with the rules that help Cursor use the CLI and the SDK.

You can also point Cursor to this web site and ask for help or advice about anything.
