# Marketing Your Game (BETA)

Run paid ad campaigns for your game straight from the `rundot` CLI. You write a short prompt, RUN.game generates the ad creatives, copy, and screenshots for you, and a campaign is submitted to Meta (Facebook / Instagram) to drive new players to your game.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is **paid user acquisition** — *spending* to bring new players to your game. To *earn* revenue by showing ads inside your game, see the [Ad Monetization API](api/ADS.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Beta feature.** Marketing commands are hidden by default. Enable them for your shell session before you start:

```bash
export RUNDOT_BETA_FEATURES=1
```

Without this set, `rundot marketing` commands won't appear in `--help`.
{% endhint %}

## How it works

You build a campaign locally, RUN.game generates the assets, and you submit it. Submitting **does not start spending money** — every campaign is reviewed by the RUN.game team and only goes live once it's approved ("flighted").

```
rundot marketing prepare   →  scaffold a campaign + write its prompt
rundot marketing generate  →  RUN.game generates ad images (AI)
rundot marketing copy      →  RUN.game writes headline / body options (AI)
rundot marketing submit    →  upload + submit for review (created PAUSED)
        │
        ▼
  RUN.game review  →  approved campaigns are flighted (go live) and start spending
        │
        ▼
rundot marketing stats     →  track spend, installs, ROAS, and more
```

All commands run from your game's project directory and use the same `game.config.prod.json` as `rundot deploy`. Add `--game-id` to target a specific game.

## 1. Prepare a campaign

```bash
rundot marketing prepare --name spring-push
```

This creates a local campaign folder under `.rundot/marketing/spring-push/`:

```
.rundot/marketing/spring-push/
  campaign.json          # the campaign manifest (prompts, targeting, etc.)
  ad-creative/           # AI-generated ad images
  screenshots/           # AI-generated or hand-uploaded screenshots
  feature-graphic/       # optional feature graphic
  video/                 # optional hand-uploaded video
  references/            # reference images that guide AI generation
```

Useful options:

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--platforms web,ios,android` | Which platforms to advertise on (default: all three). |
| `--countries US,BR,MX` | Target specific countries (2-letter ISO codes). Default: US. |
| `--age-min 21` / `--age-max 45` | Target an age range (13–65). Default: 18–65. |
| `--prompt-ad-creative "..."` | Override the ad-image prompt inline. |
| `--prompt-ad-creative-file ./prompt.md` | Provide the prompt from a file. |
| `--override` | Overwrite an existing campaign of the same name. |

Prompts default to built-in templates that fill in your game's name and description automatically. Edit `campaign.json` (or use the `--prompt-*` flags) to customize them.

## 2. Generate creatives

```bash
rundot marketing generate --name spring-push
```

RUN.game generates the ad images server-side, resizes them to spec, and downloads them into your campaign folder.

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--kind ad-creative` | Generate only one asset kind (`ad-creative`, `screenshots`, or `feature-graphic`). Omit to generate all. |
| `--variants 4` | How many variants to generate (capped per asset kind). |
| `--reference ./logo.png,https://…/art.png` | Reference images (local files or HTTPS URLs) to guide style. |
| `--regen ad-creative/0.png` | Regenerate a single asset. |
| `--new-seed` | Use a fresh random seed when regenerating. |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing assets. |

You can also hand-place your own images, screenshots, or a video into the folders instead of generating them.

## 3. Generate ad copy (optional)

```bash
rundot marketing copy --name spring-push --count 5
```

Generates headline and primary-text options for the ad. Meta automatically tests these against each other and favors the best performers.

## 4. Submit for review

```bash
rundot marketing submit --name spring-push
```

This uploads your assets and submits the campaign. The campaign is created **paused** — it is **not spending yet**. The RUN.game team reviews it, and once approved it's flighted (goes live).

You'll see the campaign move through these states (visible via `rundot marketing status`):

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `pending-review` | Submitted and waiting for review. Not spending. |
| `flighted` | Approved and live. Spending against its daily budget. |
| `rejected` | Not approved. Not spending. |
| `paused-by-creator` | You paused it. Not spending. |
| `cancelled` | Permanently stopped. |

## Reviewing performance

Check a campaign's status and budgets:

```bash
rundot marketing status --name spring-push
```

Pull performance metrics (spend, impressions, clicks, CTR, installs, CPI, revenue, ROAS, and more):

```bash
# Last 30 days as a table (default)
rundot marketing stats --name spring-push

# As CSV for a spreadsheet
rundot marketing stats --name spring-push --days 30 --format csv > spring-push.csv
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Some metrics (reach, CTR, conversions) show `—` in a table or a blank cell in CSV when the ad network didn't report them. That means **no data**, not zero.
{% endhint %}

List all your campaigns with their latest numbers:

```bash
rundot marketing list
```

## Managing a live campaign

```bash
# Change the daily budget (USD/day per platform)
rundot marketing budget --name spring-push --platforms ios,android --daily 200

# Pause spending (you can resume later)
rundot marketing pause --name spring-push
rundot marketing resume --name spring-push

# Permanently stop a campaign
rundot marketing cancel --name spring-push
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always change budgets through the CLI (or the controls the RUN.game team uses), **not** directly in Meta Ads Manager. Out-of-band edits in Ads Manager are detected automatically and will pause the campaign.
{% endhint %}

## Paying for ad spend

Campaigns are funded from your RUN.game **credits**. A few things to know:

- A campaign never spends until it's approved and flighted by the RUN.game team.
- Ad spend is drawn from your prepaid credit balance — the platform never fronts your ad cost. If your balance can't cover the next day's budget, the campaign is paused automatically.
- Pausing or cancelling a campaign refunds the unspent portion of its prepaid budget.

If a budget change is blocked for insufficient credits, top up your balance and try again.

## Asset specifications

Generated and hand-uploaded assets must meet these specs (the CLI validates them before submit):

### Images

| Kind | Aspect Ratio | Size (px) | Format | Max File Size | Max Variants |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ad creative | 9:16 | 1080 × 1920 | PNG | 8 MB | 4 |
| Screenshots | 9:16 | 1242 × 2208 | PNG | 8 MB | 4 |
| Feature graphic | 21:9 | 1024 × 500 | PNG | 8 MB | 1 |

Screenshots require a minimum of **3** at submit time. Images are resized with a "contain" fit and a blurred background fill, so they're never cropped.

### Video (optional)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Format | MP4 |
| Duration | 15–30 seconds |
| Max file size | 100 MB |

Video is hand-uploaded (not AI-generated). The first ad creative is used as its thumbnail.

### Reference images

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Max count | 4 |
| Max size per file | 5 MB |
| Formats | PNG, JPEG, WebP |
| URLs | HTTPS URLs accepted (no upload needed) |

## Content moderation

All campaigns are moderated before they reach the ad network. Headlines, body copy, and prompts are checked for profanity and policy violations, and generated/uploaded images and video are scanned. Anything that fails moderation rejects the submission with a descriptive error, so keep creatives and copy advertising-policy compliant.

## Command reference

All commands live under `rundot marketing` and require `RUNDOT_BETA_FEATURES=1`.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `prepare` | Scaffold a campaign and write `campaign.json`. |
| `generate` | Generate ad images (AI). |
| `copy` | Generate headline / body-copy options (AI). |
| `composite` | Overlay a logo or image onto a generated asset. |
| `refs` | Build the reference palette for generation. |
| `tips` | Print prompt-writing guidance and asset requirements. |
| `submit` | Upload assets and submit the campaign for review. |
| `status` | Show a campaign's status, budgets, and IDs. |
| `preview` | Render a local preview of a prepared campaign. |
| `stats` | Show performance metrics. |
| `list` | List all campaigns with their latest snapshot. |
| `budget` | Adjust a live campaign's daily budget. |
| `pause` | Pause a live campaign (refunds unspent budget). |
| `resume` | Resume a paused campaign. |
| `cancel` | Cancel a campaign permanently (refunds unspent budget). |

## How-tos

### Launch a campaign end-to-end

```bash
export RUNDOT_BETA_FEATURES=1
rundot marketing prepare  --name spring-push
# edit prompts in campaign.json if you like, then:
rundot marketing generate --name spring-push
rundot marketing copy     --name spring-push --count 5
rundot marketing submit   --name spring-push
```

The campaign is submitted **paused** and starts spending only after the RUN.game team approves and flights it.

### Target specific countries and ages

```bash
rundot marketing prepare  --name brazil-mx --countries BR,MX --age-min 21 --age-max 45
rundot marketing generate --name brazil-mx
rundot marketing submit   --name brazil-mx
```

Omit any flag to keep the default for that dimension (default audience: US, ages 18–65).

### Read performance as a spreadsheet

```bash
rundot marketing stats --name spring-push --days 30 --format csv > spring-push.csv
```

# Share an update (launch packet)

`rundot marketing` is *paid* user acquisition. A **launch packet** is the *organic* counterpart: when you ship an update, RUN.game writes platform-ready posts (X, Reddit, TikTok, Instagram, Discord), mints tracked links so plays from your posts are attributed back to you, and gives you a posting checklist.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Paid vs. organic.** Use `rundot marketing` to *spend* on ads. Use `rundot socials` to share an update to your own audience for free. They're independent — use either or both.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Beta feature.** Like `marketing`, `socials` commands are hidden until you enable beta features for your shell session:

```bash
export RUNDOT_BETA_FEATURES=1
```
{% endhint %}

## How it works

```
rundot socials prepare       →  RUN.game writes drafts + tracked links for each platform
rundot socials status        →  see the posting checklist (what's posted, what's pending)
rundot socials open <plat>   →  print the caption + a prefilled composer URL to post
rundot socials mark-posted   →  record the URL once you've posted (so @RUN can amplify it)
```

Discord is **auto-posted** server-side (if you've configured a webhook). Every other platform is **composer-assisted**: RUN.game gives you the caption and a prefilled composer link, and you click publish.

All commands run from your game's project directory and use the same game config as `rundot deploy`. Add `--game-id <id>` to target a specific game.

## 1. (One-time) configure your social profile

Your social profile is **per-creator, not per-game** — set it once and it applies to every game you publish. It customizes the generated copy and enables Discord auto-posting. It's optional — `prepare` works without it — but setting at least a Discord webhook is recommended.

```bash
rundot socials profile set \
  --discord-webhook "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/…" \
  --tone "hyped but humble" \
  --hashtags "indiegame,h5games" \
  --cta "Play now,Drop a comment" \
  --footer "Made with RUN.game" \
  --discord-username "yourname"
```

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--discord-webhook <url>` | Discord incoming webhook. Stored as a write-only secret and used to auto-post. |
| `--tone <text>` | Copy tone, e.g. `"hyped but humble"`. |
| `--hashtags a,b,c` | Hashtags to weave into captions. |
| `--cta "a,b"` | Preferred calls-to-action. |
| `--footer <text>` | Footer appended to copy. |
| `--discord-username <name>` | Your handle in RUN's community Discord. |

Inspect the current profile any time:

```bash
rundot socials profile show
```

### Setting up the Discord webhook

In **your** Discord server: **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook**, pick the announcement channel, **Copy Webhook URL**, then pass it to `profile set --discord-webhook`. RUN.game stores it as a write-only secret; `profile show` only reports whether it's configured, never the URL itself. Your webhook is stored once on your creator profile and reused across all your games. Without a webhook, Discord is skipped (the other platforms are unaffected).

## 2. Prepare a launch packet

```bash
rundot socials prepare
```

This generates drafts for all platforms against your latest public version. If a Discord webhook is configured, the Discord announcement is **posted immediately**; the rest are left as drafts for you to post.

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--update latest` | Which release to promote. `latest` (default) or a specific `versionNumber`. |
| `--platforms x,reddit,tiktok,instagram,discord` | Limit to specific platforms (default: all). |
| `--force` | Re-post to Discord even if this version was already auto-posted (idempotent by default). |
| `--json` | Machine-readable output. |
| `--game-id <id>` | Target a specific game. |

Each draft includes three caption variants (`punchy` / `sincere` / `playful`), a tracked link, and any `warnings` (for example, a variant that exceeds X's 280-character limit — the text is never silently truncated).

## 3. Check the posting checklist

```bash
rundot socials status
```

Shows each platform's mode (auto/composer), status (ready / auto-posted / posted), and tracked link.

## 4. Open a composer and post

```bash
# Prints the caption + a prefilled composer URL for X
rundot socials open x

# Pick a caption variant (1–3) and, for Reddit, a target subreddit
rundot socials open reddit --variant 2 --target IndieGaming
```

Copy the printed caption, open the URL, and publish.

### Per-platform behavior

| Platform | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Discord** | Auto-posted via your webhook. No composer to open. |
| **X** | Composer-assisted. `open x` prints a prefilled tweet URL. |
| **Reddit** | Composer-assisted. `open reddit --target <subreddit>` prints a prefilled submit URL with title + body. |
| **TikTok / Instagram** | No prefilled web composer — copy the caption and post from the app. |

### Link placement

Captions aren't equally link-friendly across platforms, so each draft tells you where the tracked link goes:

- **inline** — the tracked link goes directly in the post (e.g. X, when it doesn't hurt reach).
- **reply** — post the caption first, then add the link + `@RUN` in a reply, which keeps the main post's reach. `open` prints the reply text for you.
- **search** — the platform isn't clickable (TikTok / Instagram). Put the game name and key art on-screen and use the `Search "{game}" on @RUN` call-to-action so viewers can find it in the RUN app.

## 5. Mark posts as published

Once a post is live, record its URL. RUN.game amplifies marked posts from **@RUN**, and it keeps your checklist accurate.

```bash
rundot socials mark-posted x --url https://x.com/you/status/123
```

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--url <url>` | The published post URL (required). |
| `--packet latest` | Which packet to mark (defaults to the latest). |
| `--game-id <id>` | Target a specific game. |

## 6. Verify which steps are finished

Posting isn't the finish line. A step counts as **finished** once it's both:

1. **Posted** — Discord auto-posts; the others are recorded via `mark-posted` (and, where we can, confirmed live on the platform).
2. **Clicked by someone who isn't you** — at least one click on that step's tracked link from a profile that isn't yours.

```bash
rundot socials verify
```

Each platform reports one of three states:

- **not posted** — nothing's up yet.
- **awaiting click** — it's posted, but no one other than you has clicked the link yet. It's *not* done — RUN.game is waiting for **1 click that isn't you** before the step counts.
- **finished ✓** — posted *and* clicked by someone other than you.

TikTok and Instagram have no tracked link (search-only), so they can be marked posted but aren't finishable here.

```bash
rundot socials verify --json            # machine-readable, includes each row's state
rundot socials verify --packet <id>     # a specific packet
```

## Command reference

All commands live under `rundot socials` and require `RUNDOT_BETA_FEATURES=1`.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `prepare` | Generate a launch packet (auto-posts Discord if configured). |
| `status` | Show the posting checklist. |
| `open <platform>` | Print the caption + composer URL for a platform. |
| `mark-posted <platform> --url <url>` | Record a published post URL. |
| `verify` | Check which steps are finished (posted + ≥1 non-creator click). |
| `profile set` | Configure webhook / tone / hashtags / footer / CTAs. |
| `profile show` | Show the current social profile. |

## How-tos

### Promote an update end-to-end

```bash
export RUNDOT_BETA_FEATURES=1
rundot socials profile set --discord-webhook "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/…"  # one-time
rundot socials prepare                       # Discord auto-posts; others become drafts
rundot socials open x                         # copy caption, open composer, publish
rundot socials mark-posted x --url https://x.com/you/status/123
rundot socials status                         # confirm the checklist
rundot socials verify                         # which steps are finished (posted + a non-creator click)?
```
