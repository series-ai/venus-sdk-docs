#  CLI

## What is the  CLI?

The  CLI ([command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)) is what you'll use to administer your game and upload each new version of your game to the  platform. With just a single command, it can upload your game to  for anyone to play.

You can use the  CLI manually, like any other CLI tool in your terminal. But we also provide Cursor rules that allow you to control it with natural language and an LLM.

## Cursor can help you use the  CLI

We supply Cursor rules that let you use an LLM to control the  CLI. Most, if not all, of the CLI's commands can be controlled with natural language in Cursor.

## Getting help directly in the CLI

All commands have a `--help` option that shows usage information.
