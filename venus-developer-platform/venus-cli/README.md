# Venus CLI

## What is the Venus CLI?

The Venus CLI ([command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)) is what you'll use to administer your game and upload each new version of your game to the Venus platform. With just a single command, it can upload your game to Venus for anyone to play.

You can use the Venus CLI manually, like any other CLI tool in your terminal. But we also provide Cursor rules that allow you to control it with natural language.
