# Quickstart

## Installing the SDK

{% hint style="info" %}
**pre-requisites**:

* You need to install node.js in order to install the NPM SDK version:
  * &#x20;[Node.js — Download Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
{% endhint %}

Using the following command you'll be able to get the latest SDK version:

```shell
npm install @series-inc/venus-sdk@latest
```

{% hint style="info" %}
if you want to update the SDK version, you can run the same install commands to install latest.
{% endhint %}

That's it! No initialization required. Happy hacking! Check out our [api](api/ "mention") docs to see what's available.
